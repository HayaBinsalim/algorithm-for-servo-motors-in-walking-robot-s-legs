# algorithm-for-servo-motors-in-walking-robot-s-legs
# Description 
An algorithm for servo motors in walking robot’s legs is written. All parameters are assumptions; to be decided later. 
1.	All motors are off; angles are all 0; 0V in each
2.	All weight is shifted to the left leg 
3.	5V is applied to turn on motors 1, 2, and 3; angles are 30, 45 and 135, respectively 
4.	Right leg is balanced on the air 
5.	Right leg is moved forward for 20 cm (still in the air)
6.	Motor 2’s angle is set to 0, then Motor 1 and 3
7.	Right leg is balanced on the ground 
8.	All weight is shifted to the right leg 
9.	5V is applied to turn on motors 4, 5, and 6; angles are 30, 45, and 135, respectively 
10.	Right leg is balanced on the air 
11.	Right leg is moved forward 20cm (still in the air)
12.	Motor 5’s angle is set to 0, then Motor 4 and 6
13.	Right leg is balanced on the ground
14.	Two steps forward are done
